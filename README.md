# PHP Blog Application

Hey there! 👋 This is a **real-world PHP blog application** that I built from scratch. Think of it as your own personal WordPress alternative, but simpler and more focused on the essentials.

## What Makes This Special? ✨

This isn't just another tutorial project - it's a **production-ready blog** that you can actually use. Here's what you get:

- **🔐 User System**: People can register, login, and manage their accounts
- **👑 Admin Powers**: Admins get special privileges to manage everything
- **📝 Easy Blogging**: Create posts without the complexity of drafts - everything publishes instantly
- **💬 Real Comments**: Users can comment on posts and even edit/delete their own comments
- **📱 Mobile Ready**: Looks great on phones, tablets, and desktops
- **🛡️ Security First**: Built with real security practices (no SQL injection, CSRF protection, proper password hashing)
- **⚡ Fast & Simple**: No bloated features - just what you need for a great blog

## Built With Real-World Tools 🛠️

- **PHP 7.4+** - The backbone of everything
- **MySQL** - Your trusty database companion
- **HTML5/CSS3** - Clean, modern frontend
- **PDO** - Safe database interactions (no SQL injection worries!)
- **Password Hashing** - Your users' passwords are actually secure

## Getting Started (The Real Way) 🚀

Ready to get this running? Here's how to set it up like a pro:

### Step 1: Get the Code

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd PHP-BLOG-APP
```

### Step 2: Set Up Your Database

1. Fire up your MySQL (XAMPP, WAMP, or whatever you prefer)
2. Create a new database called `php_blog_app`
3. Import the `database.sql` file - this creates all your tables

### Step 3: Configure Your Settings

1. Copy `config.sample.php` to `config.php`
2. Open `config.php` and update your database credentials:
   ```php
   define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
   define('DB_NAME', 'php_blog_app');
   define('DB_USER', 'root');
   define('DB_PASS', 'your_password_here');
   ```
3. **Pro tip**: Never commit `config.php` - it's already in `.gitignore` for you!

### Step 4: Deploy and Test

1. Drop everything into your web server directory
2. Visit `http://localhost/PHP-BLOG-APP/`
3. You should see your shiny new blog! 🎉

## How It All Works Under the Hood 🔧

The database is pretty straightforward - just three main tables:

- **`users`** - Where all your users live (with proper password hashing!)
- **`posts`** - All your blog content
- **`comments`** - User comments (with edit/delete powers)

## Quick Start - Default Admin Account 🚀

Want to test it out immediately? Use these credentials:

- **Email**: admin@blog.com
- **Password**: admin123

_Don't forget to change this in production!_ 😉

## What's Inside This Project 📁

Here's how everything is organized (spoiler: it's actually pretty clean):

```
PHP-BLOG-APP/
├── admins/           # Admin-only pages (manage posts, users, etc.)
├── assets/           # Your CSS, JS, and pretty pictures
├── auth/             # Login, register, logout pages
├── comments/         # Comment management (edit, delete)
├── includes/         # The brain of the operation (database, security, etc.)
├── partials/         # Reusable components (navbar, footer)
├── posts/            # Post viewing pages
├── users/            # User dashboard
├── admin.php         # Admin dashboard (the control center)
├── index.php         # Your homepage
└── database.sql      # The database blueprint
```

## Security That Actually Matters 🛡️

I didn't just throw this together - security was a priority from day one:

- **🔒 Password Hashing**: Using PHP's `password_hash()` - no plain text passwords here!
- **🛡️ CSRF Protection**: Every form has tokens to prevent sneaky attacks
- **💉 SQL Injection Prevention**: PDO prepared statements everywhere (no `mysql_query()` nonsense)
- **🧹 Input Validation**: Everything gets cleaned before hitting the database
- **🔐 Session Security**: Proper session management with timeouts

_This isn't just a demo - it's built to handle real users safely._
